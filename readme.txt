== Description ==

= A simple and customizable Likes plugin for your website's content =

Nice Likes easily adds likes functionality to your website without requiring you to write a single line of code, while offering a lot of possibilities for developers to extend its functionality. You can make use of likes natively or add them with a template tag (PHP function).

This plugin is fully integrated with WordPress. It makes use of its native architecture to show likes for your content, and includes a huge set of hooks, so you can customize it in any way you need.

Nice Likes works right out of the box with any theme.

Nice Likes is developed following the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to set up the plugin? =

Once you installed and activated the plugin, you can go to *Settings > Likes* and tweak the options there.

= How to integrate with my templates? =

The simplest way to include likes in your own templates is using our `nice_likes()` function. This is a very basic usage example:

`
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'nice_likes' ) ) :
	nice_likes( array( 'echo' => true ) );
endif;
?>
`

However, we recommend you to use the `nice_likes_custom` action, which allows to select via Likes Settings where likes will be displayed. In the settings page, you'll be presented with three options for the location of your likes: before your post content, after your post content, or in a custom location. If you chose the later, you're gonna need to add `<?php do_action( 'nice_likes_custom' ); ?>` to the the part of your template where you want your likes to display, while still having the possibility to move them to the top or bottom of your content in case you need to.

= How can I use my own CSS? =

You can load a custom stylesheet by using [wp_enqueue_script()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script) and adding your custom CSS to your own file. However, if you *really* want to get rid of the default CSS of Nice Likes, so you can avoid overriding our styles, you can check the "Avoid Plugin CSS" option in *Settings > Likes*.
